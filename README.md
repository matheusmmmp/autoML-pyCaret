## ✎About

This notebook is a form to practice my knowledge in data science, mostly with the AutoML using PyCaret library in Python. It walks us through a workflow for solving a problem with credit using a comparing different models for the same dataset. 

The main purpose of this notebook is to serve as a step-by-step workflow guide, allowing me to review this notebook myself and serve as a study for future cases.

This notebook was developed within the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10ejzuf_4Vgnn_65nrWpEv-XsSVOaZRkA?usp=sharing) environment.
